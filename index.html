      <h2>Accessibility in the World of Technology</h2>
    </header>
<article>
  <p>As technology continues to develop, more of our daily lives rely on the tech to accomplish daily tasks.
  Things such as ordering groceries, researching health information, and just watching funny videos of cats are all
  reliant on our computers, smart phones, and tablets.</p>
  <p>However, the reliance on technology can be challenging for individuals with accessibility needs. It is necessary to consider
  individuals who may not be able to see, hear, or have cognitive disabilities when designing websites and applications.</p>
  <blockquote>Accessibility needs to be a top priority for technology companies in order to prioritize inclusion.
  Without accessibility featuers, such as screen readers and voice over capabilites, large communities of people may be excluded from the use
  of different apps and websites.</blockquote>
